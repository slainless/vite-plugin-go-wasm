A less opinionated and customizable Vite plugin that allows building, transforming, and loading Go code as WASM.

Designed as a replacement to [vite-plugin-golang-wasm](https://github.com/slainless/vite-plugin-golang-wasm). Instead of catering to one loading style, this plugin allows mix-and-matching of custom build/transform directive, allowing broader use case.
